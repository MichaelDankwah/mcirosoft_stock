# Financial Performance Analysis of Microsoft's Stock Using Tableau

## Description of the Dataset

For this project, I analyzed Microsoft's stock price data spanning the last 38 years. The dataset includes key columns such as the date, opening price, highest price of the day, lowest price of the day, closing price, adjusted closing price, and trading volume. Additionally, I incorporated the NASDAQ Composite index data starting from 2014 to perform a comparative analysis of Microsoft's stock performance relative to the broader market.

## Combining Datasets for Comparative Analysis

To provide a comprehensive analysis, I merged Microsoft's dataset with the NASDAQ Composite index dataset. This involved aligning the dates and ensuring that the data was consistently formatted for accurate comparison. The NASDAQ data was crucial in contextualizing Microsoft's performance within the broader market trends.

## Techniques Employed and Skills Acquired

During this project, I employed various data analytics and visualization techniques using Tableau. Here are the key techniques and skills I developed:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Ensured consistency in date formats.
   - Merged multiple datasets.
   - Calculated derived metrics such as daily volatility (difference between the highest and lowest prices).

2. **Visualization Techniques:**
   - Created line charts, bar charts, and area charts to visualize trends.
   - Developed dashboards to present findings interactively.
   - Employed tooltips and annotations for detailed insights.

3. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Analyzed trends in stock prices over several decades.
   - Examined seasonal patterns by comparing monthly and yearly performance.
   - Evaluated volatility trends and their implications.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compared Microsoft's stock performance with the NASDAQ Composite index.
   - Analyzed trading volumes for both Microsoft and the NASDAQ Composite.

## Findings from the Visualizations

1. **Trends in Microsoft’s Stock Price Over the Last 38 Years:**
   - The average closing price of Microsoft's stock has shown a consistent increase over the past 38 years. A significant surge was observed from 2016 onward, with 2024 already surpassing the previous year's closing prices.

2. **Microsoft’s Stock Performance by Month and Year:**
   - The 1990s showed modest average closing prices, peaking in 1999 and early 2000. From late 2016, there was a notable improvement in average closing prices, with 2024 recording the highest averages so far.

3. **Volatility Analysis:**
   - The highest volatility was recorded in 2022. Between 2001 and 2016, volatility was relatively low, but it increased significantly from 2017 onwards.

4. **Comparative Performance with NASDAQ:**
   - Both Microsoft and the NASDAQ Composite index showed increasing average closing prices from 2014. While both experienced declines in 2022, Microsoft recovered faster and continued to increase in 2023 and 2024, surpassing previous highs. NASDAQ also surpassed its best tally by mid-2024.

5. **Volume Comparison with NASDAQ:**
   - Microsoft's highest average trading volume was in 2020. NASDAQ also saw a significant increase in trading volume in 2020. By May 2024, NASDAQ had already surpassed its highest recorded average trading volume. In 2021, Microsoft experienced a notable reduction in average trading volume.

## Presentation of Findings

I have created interactive dashboards in Tableau to present these findings effectively. The dashboards include various visualizations that allow users to explore the data and insights interactively. These dashboards highlight key trends, compare performances, and showcase the volatility and trading volumes over time.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to perform comprehensive data analysis using Tableau, including data preparation, merging datasets, calculating derived metrics, and creating insightful visualizations. The findings from this project provide a detailed look into Microsoft's stock performance over several decades, highlighting key trends and comparisons with the NASDAQ Composite index. These skills and techniques are crucial for a career in data analytics, and I am confident that this project demonstrates my capability to analyze complex datasets and derive meaningful insights.
